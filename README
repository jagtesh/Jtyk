Jtyk (Jay-tyke) - JSON, the YAML killer.

Jtyk is a simple library that propogates the use of JSON where you'd otherwise use YAML or XML, primarily for writing config files.

Pros:
- JSON is widely used
- Officially supported in some languages (PHP)
- Most web developers are familiar with it already
- Provides a simple concise way to write config files in web projects

Cons:
- People from a non-web development background may not be familiar to it (which still makes it an equally capable contendor as YAML or XML)
